# This files was intended to use on the real coded data, because the second coder
# is only going to be coding a portion of what the first coder coded, the original
# reliability script needed to be adjusted to account for this.

# Functions to compute reliability between two coder's data on the same child.
# These functions work on the frame-exported data from Datavyu.

# This function requires that the data has been exported into .txt. files and are
# delimited with a bracket " ] ", using the "FrameExport.rb" file. Exporting the
# frame data with FrameExport.rb will ensure they are exported with a specific frame
# rate.
